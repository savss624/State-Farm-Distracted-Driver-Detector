# State Farm Distracted Driver Detection

***[State Farm Distracted Driver Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection/code) was originally a Kaggle Project.***</br>
Kaggle is the battle arena and training ground for applied deep learning challenges and I have been drawn to one in particular: the State Farm Distracted Driver Detection challenge.

According to the CDC motor vehicle safety division, one in five car accidents is caused by a distracted driver. Sadly, this translates to 425,000 people injured and 3,000 people killed by distracted driving every year.

[State Farm](https://www.statefarm.com) hopes to improve these alarming statistics, and better insure their customers, by testing whether dashboard cameras can automatically detect drivers engaging in distracted behaviors.

## Data
In this challenge we are given a training set of about 20K photos of drivers who are either in a focused or distracted state (e.g. holding phone, putting make up, etc.). The test set consists of around 80K images. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify a given driver photo among a set of 10 classes.

## Now, Let's Build The Model
